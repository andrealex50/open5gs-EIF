------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**nwdaf_instance_id** | **char \*** | String uniquely identifying a NF instance. The format of the NF Instance ID shall be a  Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) version 4, as described in IETF RFC 4122.   | 
**nwdaf_set_id** | **char \*** | NF Set Identifier (see clause 28.12 of 3GPP TS 23.003), formatted as the following string \&quot;set&lt;Set ID&gt;.&lt;nftype&gt;set.5gc.mnc&lt;MNC&gt;.mcc&lt;MCC&gt;\&quot;, or  \&quot;set&lt;SetID&gt;.&lt;NFType&gt;set.5gc.nid&lt;NID&gt;.mnc&lt;MNC&gt;.mcc&lt;MCC&gt;\&quot; with  &lt;MCC&gt; encoded as defined in clause 5.4.2 (\&quot;Mcc\&quot; data type definition)  &lt;MNC&gt; encoding the Mobile Network Code part of the PLMN, comprising 3 digits.    If there are only 2 significant digits in the MNC, one \&quot;0\&quot; digit shall be inserted    at the left side to fill the 3 digits coding of MNC.  Pattern: &#39;^[0-9]{3}$&#39; &lt;NFType&gt; encoded as a value defined in Table 6.1.6.3.3-1 of 3GPP TS 29.510 but    with lower case characters &lt;Set ID&gt; encoded as a string of characters consisting of    alphabetic characters (A-Z and a-z), digits (0-9) and/or the hyphen (-) and that    shall end with either an alphabetic character or a digit.   | [optional] 
**analytics_ids** | [**list_t**](event_id.md) \* |  | [optional] 
**supported_features** | **char \*** | A string used to indicate the features supported by an API that is used as defined in clause  6.6 in 3GPP TS 29.500. The string shall contain a bitmask indicating supported features in  hexadecimal representation Each character in the string shall take a value of \&quot;0\&quot; to \&quot;9\&quot;,  \&quot;a\&quot; to \&quot;f\&quot; or \&quot;A\&quot; to \&quot;F\&quot; and shall represent the support of 4 features as described in  table 5.2.2-3. The most significant character representing the highest-numbered features shall  appear first in the string, and the character representing features 1 to 4 shall appear last  in the string. The list of features and their numbering (starting with 1) are defined  separately for each API. If the string contains a lower number of characters than there are  defined features for an API, all features that would be represented by characters that are not  present in the string are not supported.  | [optional]
